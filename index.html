		<!--The main research paragraph starts-->
		<p>Time travel has been a concept that has been entertained in many different ways in many common media sources like books, movies, and TV shows. These are all technichally things humanity could do, but it would be an unfathomably long time before it would be achieved. One way you could technically travel back in time would be to essentially bend space time into an isolated bubble, where time is reserved. Then if many years pass, it would be a somewhat feasible method of time travel. These are all very interesting concepts, but this article will talk about something that is actually achievable right now... kind of.</p>
		<p><br>Time manipulation is something that is possible right now in very small amounts. It requires someone to either travel really fast, or be closer to a source of gravity. This is possible because of the theory of relativity, stating that time and space aren't two seperate ideas, they are instead one, known as spacetime. This basically means that if someone moves faster through space, they travel slower through time, and vice versa. This leeds to some things that seem simple being really complicated instead, like the satellites that are used for gps locations have to add extra time to their clocks, otherwise it would be way off.</p>
