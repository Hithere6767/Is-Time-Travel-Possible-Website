		<h1>Why Time Travel Likely Won't Be Possible, But Time Manipulation Will.</h1>

		<!--The main research paragraph starts-->
		<p id="mainParas">Time travel has been a concept that has been entertained in many different ways in many common media sources like books, movies, and TV shows. These are all technichally things humanity could do, but it would be an unfathomably long time before it would be achieved. One way you could technically travel back in time would be to essentially bend space time into an isolated bubble, where time is reserved. Then if many years pass, it would be a somewhat feasible method of time travel. These are all very interesting concepts, but this website will talk about something that is actually achievable right now... kind of.</p>
		<p id="mainParas">Time manipulation is something that is possible right now in very small amounts. It requires someone to either travel really fast, or be closer to a source of gravity. This is possible because of the theory of relativity, stating that time and space aren't two seperate ideas, they are instead one, known as spacetime. This basically means that if someone moves faster through space, they travel slower through time, and vice versa. This leads to some things that seem simple being really complicated instead, like the GPS example in the article <span id="source">Is Time Travel Possible</span>  "GPS satellites orbit around Earth very quickly at about 8,700 miles (14,000 kilometers) per hour. This slows down GPS satellite clocks by a small fraction of a second"<br></p>
		<p id="mainParas">As stated in </span><span id="source">Time Travel, Fact or Fiction </span><span>"Basically, the problem is that of the "grandfather paradox": what happens if our time traveller kills his grandfather before he himself was born?" This is a very big problem with time travel. It creates a never ending loop of killing your grandfather and not killing your grandfather. There is a theory that this creates a second timeline, or universe, where you were never born. The problem of conserving mass and energy still arises. If someone where to appear out of thin air, that is an extra person's mass appearing out of nowhere, along with a ton of energy inside the body.<br></p>
